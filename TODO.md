# TODO for Circalizer

There are additional TODOÂ notes inside the jupyter notebook.

1. Make the readers and plotting functions generic and able to process any kind of input data.
2. Stack all plots together with a shared timeline, to ease comparison.
3. Customize colors and legends in datashader plots:

4. Add some stats, such as rolling average/min/high points per 24h (bokeh supports this feature).
